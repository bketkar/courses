Problem 1: 
Express matrix addition as an SQL query.  Assume you have two matrices A and B represented as follows:

A(row_number, column_number, value)
B(row_number, column_number, value)

Example of using this representation: 
To retrive the value of A[i,j], you would write

SELECT value FROM A WHERE row_number = i AND column_number = j



Problem 2 (Optional):  
Express term-frequency, inverse-document frequency measure in SQL.  

The result should be a relation (term, tfidf) that gives the tfidf score of each term.

Read more at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">Wikipedia page about tf-idf</a>

Assume you are given a table with the frequencies of each term in each document:

frequency(term, docid, count)

There are many variants of tf-idf -- keep it simple!  

If you'd like, you can use can use <a href="http://sqlshare.escience.washington.edu/">SQLShare</a> to test your solution. I've posted a <a href="https://sqlshare.escience.washington.edu/sqlshare#s=query/billhowe/reuters_terms.csv&q=">SQLShare dataset providing the term frequencies for a subset of the Reuters document corpus</a>
