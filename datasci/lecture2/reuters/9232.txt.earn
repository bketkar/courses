olson <olsn> to have loss from egg unit sale
    sherman okas, calif., march 25 - 
olson industries inc said it is in final negotiations on the sale of
its remaining egg operations and expects the sale to generate a charge
of about two mln dlrs against 1987 net income. the company said,
however, that the sale will generate substantial cash flow to pay off
bank debt and improve working capital, eliminate unmanageable effects
on profits of the price instability of the egg business and allow it
to concentrate on its plastics packaging business. reuter 
