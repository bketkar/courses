‚Äútend to be ‚Äúhard scientists‚Äù, particularly physicists, rather than computer science majors.  Physicists have a strong mathematical background, computing skills, and come from a discipline in which survival depends on getting the most from the data.  They have to think about the big picture, the big problem.‚Äù

"They need to find nuggets of truth in data and then explain it to the business leaders"

My view:
"Statistics at scale"

"Here is a bunch of data.  Here is my question."
-- supervised learning

"Here is a bunch of data.  What is important here?"
-- unsupervised learning

Hal Varian, Google‚Äôs Chief Economist, was interviewed a few months ago, and said the following in the McKinsey Quarterly:
‚ÄúThe sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians‚Ä¶ The ability to take data‚Äîto be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it‚Äîthat‚Äôs going to be a hugely important skill.‚Äù

Skill #1: Statistics (Studying).
Skill #2: Data Munging (Suffering). 
Skill #3: Visualization (Storytelling).



Simpler models with more data trump sophisticated models with less data

"More data" introduces its own challenges

Spectrum: mathematical sophistication -- scalable algorithms
Data science about a 7 and heading right
Statistics: Born out of data-poor scenarios

Tools: Promiscuity is important.   No one-size-fits-all

IT may build applications for others to use: Data scientists eat their own dog food.  Your deliverable is a data-driven decision, not an application. (Though in the process, you may build applications to empower others)

Business intelligence: It's all about Data Warehousing, and DW is all about up-front organization to drive specific reports and dashboards.  Incorporating new data is difficult

Ben Fry (Process):
1. acquire ‚Äì the matter of obtaining the data, whether from a file 
on a disk or from a source over a network.
2. parse ‚Äì providing some structure around what the data means, 
ordering it into categories.
3. filter ‚Äì removing all but the data of interest.
4. mine ‚Äì the application of methods from statistics or data 
mining, as a way to discern patterns or place the data in mathematical context.
5. represent ‚Äì determination of a simple representation, whether 
the data takes one of many shapes such as a bar graph, list, or 
tree.
6. refine ‚Äì improvements to the basic representation to make it 
clearer and more visually engaging.
7. interact ‚Äì the addition of methods for manipulating the data or 
controlling what features are visible.

1974 Peter Naur, Concise Survey of Computer Methods 

Course plan was presented at the IFIP Congress in 1968, titled ‚ÄúDatalogy, the science of data and of data processes and its place in education"

‚ÄúThe science of dealing with data, once they have been established, while the relation of the data to what they represent is delegated to other fields and sciences.‚Äù


2001: William Cleveland Bell Labs

(25%) Multidisciplinary Investigations: data analysis collaborations in a collection of subject matter areas. 
(20%) Models and Methods for Data: statistical models; methods of model building; methods of estimation and distribution based on probabilistic inference.  
(15%) Computing with Data: hardware systems; software systems; computational algorithms.  
(15%) Pedagogy: curriculum planning and approaches to teaching for elementary school, secondary
school, college, graduate school, continuing education, and corporate training.  
(5%) Tool Evaluation: surveys of tools in use in practice, surveys of perceived needs for new tools, and studies of the processes for developing new tools.



Key idea: extract information from large datasets and then present something of use to non-data experts

Ben] Fry‚Ä¶ argues for an entirely new field that combines the skills and talents from often disjoint areas of expertise‚Ä¶ [computer science; mathematics, statistics, and data mining; graphic design; infovis and human-computer interaction]
