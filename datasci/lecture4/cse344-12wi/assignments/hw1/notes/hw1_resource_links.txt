**Notes about SQLite3 data types**

1. There is no storage class specifically for boolean in sqlite3. Instead sqlite.org says that they use the integer values 1 and 0 as boolean values.

2. There is no storage class specifically for date/time in sqlite3. Instead sqlite.org says that they support 5 different date/time functions to convert date/time strings.

The above information on sqlite3 data types can be found here:
http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html

Info on the actual date/time functions here:
http://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html

**Some useful pages for hw1**

This page is pretty useful as a simple guide for command-line functions  in sqlite3:
http://www.pantz.org/software/sqlite/sqlite_commands_and_general_usage.html

This page is very useful for formatting your output (under the header "changing output formats"):

The resources on sqlite.org for writing sql statements look a little complicated (curvy flow chart-like graphs). If you want to take a look:
