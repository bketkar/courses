Notes for the future:
- Update assignment instructions to include query runtimes with and without indexes.
- Update instructions to indicate time to load the data and time to build indexes.
- Double-check and indicate that group by can be much slower than distinct in SQLite.
- Odd SQLite behavior: can select attributes that did not appear in the group by! E.g. group by id but select fname.

Common student problems
- selection v. join in index choice explanations
- replicating indexes on PRIMARY KEY columns (ok because we didn't warn on it)
- problem 2: errors in data entry, historical figures with reused footage.

================================================================
Winter 2012

-- I did not update the assignment, and the same issues came up.  

-- Also, query 3 runs much slower than 15'; should update the
   assignment to say that.
