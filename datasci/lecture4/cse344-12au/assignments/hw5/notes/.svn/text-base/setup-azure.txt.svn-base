Instructions for setting up the SQL Azure student accounts and databases for homework 5:

1. Run the Python script create-tables-hw5.py under the assignments/azure directory to generate the master.sql file of SQL commands for creating the necessary accounts and databases.
2. Execute each CREATE DATABASE statement in master.sql on the master db. 
3. For each student database created execute the following generated statements from master.sql to setup permissions/accounts on each student's new DB:
  CREATE USER STUDENTID FOR LOGIN STUDENTID;
  GRANT CREATE TABLE TO STUDENTID;
  EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_owner', N'STUDENTID'

where STUDENTID is the uw Net ID.  The permissions, 'db_owner', allows the student to be able to write and create new tables in their database.
