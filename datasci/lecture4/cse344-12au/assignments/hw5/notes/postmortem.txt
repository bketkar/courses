We were too ambitious re the suffix/substring "index" described
in the original notes.  It turned out to be not all that useful
at speeding up the queries anyway.

The main program limits fastsearch to search only on a single word.
This is an artifact of the index experimentation, and should
have been removed before publishing.

In the starter code, first and last names are swapped in
the search output for director names.

We should maybe require a stock 1 or 2 usernames and passwords in all
sample data.

Very few students seem to have taken our many hints about how to 
ensure serializability, despite Postgres' phantom problem,
by forcing a write-read or write-write conflict on existing data.

It's also common for students to hand in a setup.sql that is in the
wrong order; that is, tables are defined to reference tables
defined later, and similarly for sample data.

Another common mistake is to do SQL injection prevention by string
sanitization.  Maybe we should make more clear that parameterized
SQL, through JDBC PreparedStatement objects, is the way to go.
I hinted at it in section.
