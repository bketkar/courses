- Need to update the starter code in "additional-files"
  and the solution to NOT refer to any postgres stuff.

- Remove the READ_ONLY transaction stuff if it is not
  available in T-SQL.

- We can drop all the Locks tables from the assignment.

- Minor: Need to make sure the code (starter and solution) 
  indentation is correct. Should be something simple like
  select all in emacs and get emacs to re-indent.
