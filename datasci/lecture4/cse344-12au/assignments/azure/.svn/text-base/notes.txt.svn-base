Step 1: Ask Magda who to email to get access to SQL Azure.

Step 2: Create a new hotmail account:

- Admin name: cse344-12au@hotmail.com
- Password: Database-Course

Step 3: Once they get back to you, follow their
instructions to get the account activated.
Remember! They will send emails to the
new hotmail account!

Step 4: Set-up IMDB on SQL Azure

4.1) Follow the most recent
instructions available to log in to the
Azure management portal.

4.2) Create a new SQL Azure database
You need to click around to do this. The
instructions change over time. In the past,
we had to first create a server. Now, this doesn't
seem to be necessary.

Use the hotmail account login (cse344-12au)/password.

4.3) Manage the server to create a firewall rule that
says from 0.0.0.0 up to 255.255.255.255
everyone can connect.

4.5) To create tables and upload data
check-out cse344-datasets and
see the README.txt and create-tables.sql
(see the README
in /cse/courses/cse344/your-quarter/README for
instructions on checking out cse344-datasets)


Step 5: Getting students started

See assignments/azure/create-accounts.py

Step 5.1) Establish a connection to the master database.
For each student, create a login as follows...
CREATE LOGIN StudentLogin WITH PASSWORD=N'SQLcse344' 
CREATE USER StudentLogin FOR LOGIN StudentLogin

Step 5.2) Now switch to the IMDB database:
(yes, the user must be in both databases)
CREATE USER StudentLogin FOR LOGIN StudentLogin
EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_datareader',N'StudentLogin'
GRANT SHOWPLAN TO StudentLogin
