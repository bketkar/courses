Follow these steps to set up the static code pages:

1) Create a class list in the format of codes.csv. Remember to use their cse usernames because the security will be using kerebros authentication.

2) Run the generate.py script. 

python generate.py <class list from step 1> <directory where the webpages should go>

Eg. python generate.py codes.csv amazoncodes

3) Place the index.html in the directory with all the folders for various users and direct students to go to the index.html for their codes.
