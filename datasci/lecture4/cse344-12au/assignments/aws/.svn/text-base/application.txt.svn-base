CSE 344 is our introductory-level database course.  It is offered twice a year and it is taken by about 60 students every time it is offered. 

In this course, we cover relational database management systems (DBMSs), SQL, jdbc, transactions, XML, databases as a service (including the various Amazon Web Services), and parallel DBMSs (including Amazon Elastic Map Reduce and Pig Latin)

As part of this course, students complete one assignment on data intensive scalable computing. In this assignment, students write Pig Latin scripts and run these scripts on a Hadoop cluster. In addition to learning how to write Pig Latin scripts, students experiment with the scalability of MapReduce-type systems and with parallel data processing in general. This quarter, the assignment will be similar to the one we had last quarter, where students played with the billion triple dataset: http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse344/12wi/hw/hw6/hw6.html

Thanks to Amazon's generosity, we have been using Amazon Elastic MapReduce since Fall of 2009 as part of our undergraduate database courses.  We are requesting a renewal of Amazon's generous support by providing credits for using Amazon's Web Services, with Elastic MapReduce and support for Pig.
