  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dd>Databases are at the heart of modern
    commercial application development. Their use extends beyond this to
    many other environments and domains where large amounts of data must
    be stored for efficient update, retrieval, and analysis. The purpose of this
    course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the use of 
    management systems for applications. Some of the topics covered are the following: data models (relational and XML), query languages (SQL, datalog, XQuery), transactions, parallel data processing, and database as a service. For the detailed list of topics and schedule, please see the course <a href="./Calendar.html">calendar</a>. </dd>

  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dd>The class meets three times a week for lectures. We will follow parts of the textbook (see
    below). While the lectures are designed to be clear and self-contained, and
    to cover all the material used in class, you are strongly
    encouraged to read from the textbook, both in order to get a better
    understanding of the material covered and to learn about related
    topics, which are not covered in class. Please note that the lectures will be a combination of whiteboard, powerpoint, and live demos. Lecture notes will be made available online, but they are <em>brief and insufficient to learn the material</em>. The lesson is: <strong>do not miss classes and take notes</strong>.</dd>
  <dd><br />
    In addition to the lecture there will be two sections taught by the TAs. The sections will discuss the material taught in class, will give detailed instructions on how to use some of the software needed for the homework assignments, and will give you
  an extra opportunity to ask questions.<br />
  <br />
  There will be several homework
  assignments, involving light programming, and several Webquizes on Gradiance. <br />

  <h4>Main textbook:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Database Systems: the Complete Handbook, by Hector
      Garcia-Molina,
      Jennifer Widom,
      and Jeffrey Ullman. Available from the University Bookstore. <strong>Second edition</strong>. </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Other Web sources::</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>SQL for Nerds</b>, by Philip Greenspun,
      at&nbsp; <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/sql/">http://philip.greenspun.com/sql/</a>&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Other texts:</h4>
  The library has the following that you might find useful if you
  require another explanation of a topic.
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Fundamentals of database systems</b> by Elsmasri and
      Navathe.</li>
    <li> <b>Database management systems</b> by Raghu
      Ramakrishnan
      and Johannes Gehrke.</li>
    <li> <b>Foundations of database systems</b> by Abiteboul,
      Hull
      and Vianu.</li>

  <dt><b><font class="colored-heading">Late Policy</font></b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
  <li>Homework assignments: you are allowed a total of <strong>3 late-days</strong> that you can use in 24-hour chunks at anytime. Please note that once you use-up your late days, no additional extensions will be granted for any reason at all. You should thus save your late-days only for true emergencies.</li>
  <li>Webquizes: there are no late days allowances for Webquizes, but <span class="style12">we will drop your lowest score (for example, if you miss one Webquiz, that won't count).</span> You may retry a webquz as often as you want: the highest score you have achieved on Gradiance as of the due date is your score for that assignment.</li>
</ul>

  <dt>&nbsp;<b class="colored-heading">Attendance</b></dt>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dd>We hope
    you will attend every lecture. If you miss a
    lecture, talk to a
    friend who was present, and be sure to check the Web site for class
    messages. </dd>
</dl>
<dl><dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b><font class="colored-heading">Programming</font></b></dt>
  <dd>Some programming will be
    necessary in this course. One can
    only start to appreciate database systems by actually trying to use
    one.  Databases only hold the data, the <i>application logic</i> needs
    to be written in some general purpose language. We will use the following tools in class:
    <ul>
      <li>SQLite</li>
      <li>XQuery (saxon he)</li>
      <li>SQL Server </li>
      <li>Java</li>
      <li>Pig Latin (through Amazon Web Services) </li>
    </ul>

  <dt><b><font class="colored-heading">Computer Use Policy</font></b></dt>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dd>Some excerpts from the campus <a href="http://www.washington.edu/tech_home/Trouble.html" target="_new">policies</a>.
    Take them seriously: &quot;You must use all UW [computing] resources in
    strict
    accordance with local, state, and federal laws. These laws cover such
    areas
    as illegal access to computer systems, networks, and files; copyright
    violations;
    and harassment issues... Software and information resources provided
    through
    the university for use by faculty, staff, and students may be used on
    computing
    equipment only as specified in the various software licenses.
    Unauthorized
    use of software, images, or files is regarded as a serious matter and
    any
    such use is without the consent of the University of Washington...If
    abuse
    of computer software, images, or files occurs, those responsible for
    such
    abuse will be held legally accountable.&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><b><font class="colored-heading">Academic Misconduct</font></b></dt>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dd>All work turned in is expected to be your own.
    Although students
    are encouraged to study together, each student is expected to produce
    his
    or her own solution to the homework problems. Coping or using sections
    of someone else's program, even if it has been modified by you, is not
    acceptable. The University has very clear guidelines for academic
    misconduct
    and the staff of CSE 344 will be vigorous in enforcing them.</dd>
