How to run SQLite (sqlite3):
  On the Linux lab machines, or a recent Macintosh: 
    Open a terminal, then run the command:
      sqlite3 database
    where "database" is the name of the database file you want to use.
    WARNING: If you don't specify a database file, sqlite3 won't complain,
    but your data will be lost!

  On the Windows lab machines: 
    Open a Cygwin terminal, then proceed as if you were on Linux.
    If that doesn't work, you may need to install the "sqlite3" 
    Cygwin package from Cygwin Setup.  If *that* doesn't work, 
    try downloading sqlite yourself.

  Download it yourself: 
    Get the "sqlite-shell" binary for your OS from:
      http://www.sqlite.org/download.html
    Extract "sqlite3" or "sqlite3.exe" from the archive and run it 
    from a command line.


SQLite . commands (not SQL):
  .help - lists other . commands
  .headers on/off - show/hide column headers in query results
  .mode - how to separate the columns in each row/tuple
  .read 'filename.sql' - read and execute SQL code from the given file
  .exit - exit from sqlite3


Run through the SQL in section1.sql
