In both sections:
- I did not cover accessing the job tracker using lynx on the master node.
- We ran overtime by about 5-7 minutes.
  I did course evals first, students finished early (15 mins instead of 20).
  --> Hence, the planned material should fit (with slight overtime) 
      into a 50-minute regular-term section, *if* course evals are done
      another week.

Section AA:
I did not cover how to download the output directory from HDFS to the master, 
or how to copy data from the master node to the local computer,
because of lack of time to wait for the example job to finish.
--> In future, I should run the example job before both sections, then move 
    the output files to another HDFS directory (to avoid Hadoop errors caused
    by the attempt to overwrite existing files).
    The plan is already updated to reflect this idea.

Section AB:
- I read the full statement of course evaluation instructions, because there
  are summer-only and new-to-UW students in AB, and I wasn't sure if any
  were present that day.
- I finished everything in plan (except as stated under "In both sections"),
  including how to retrieve output files (using the job output from AA).
