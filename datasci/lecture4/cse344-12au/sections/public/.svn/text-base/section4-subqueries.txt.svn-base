CSE 344 Section 4 Plan
- Explain relational Algebra again. Should be straight forward

- Queries, with relational algebra
- List all the actors who starred in "Forrest Gump"
		select a.fname, a.lname
		from actor a, casts c, movie m
		where a.id = c.pid and c.mid = m.id and m.name = 'Forrest Gump'
		
1. For each movie with at least 5 actors, compute the avergae number
   of roles per actor.

   SELECT m.name, COUNT(*) / COUNT(DISTINCT c.aid) AS average
   FROM Movie m, Casts c
   WHERE m.id = c.mid
   GROUP BY m.id, m.name
   HAVING COUNT (DISTINCT c.aid) >= 5
   ;

2. For all actors who appear in more than 50 movies made after 1950,
   get the number of such movies they were in.

   SELECT a.fname, a.lname, COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) AS movie_count
   FROM Actor a, Casts c, Movie m
   WHERE a.id = c.mid
     AND c.mid = m.id
     AND m.year > 1950
   GROUP BY a.id, a.fname, a.lname
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) > 50
   ;

3. Compute the average number of roles per movie.

   SELECT AVG(role_count)
   FROM (
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS role_count
     FROM Casts
     GROUP BY mid
   ) counts
   ;

4. Give all the actors who only appear in movies before 2000.

   SELECT *
   FROM Actor a
   WHERE 2000 > ALL (
     SELECT m.year
     FROM Casts c, Movie m
     WHERE a.id = c.pid
       AND c.mid = m.id
   )
   ;

   [do alternative SQL queries exist?]

5. Give all the directors who did not make a movie in 2004.

   SELECT *
   FROM Directors d
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (
     SELECT *
     FROM Movie_Directors md, Movie m
     WHERE md.did = d.id AND m.year = 2004
   )
   ;
